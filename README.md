The TDS-2 is the next guitar pedal in the TDS series, with an improved design and use of a standard enclosure.

The main features of the TDS-2 are the use of clipping diodes and a buffering stage, before the op-amp that amplifies the base signal. I've also used a 3PDT footswitch and some audio jacks that hold the line low when no jack is inserted, just to make sure i don't get any unecessary noise.

The enclosure I picked for this pedal and subsequent versions of it is the Hammond 1590B, since it's made out of aluminium it's relatively cheap and effective.

I used this datasheet to get the dimensions needed for the PCB, and i found that 10cm x 5cm is more than enough. 

This project is not intended for beginners, but with a little guidance it can be a successful starting project.
